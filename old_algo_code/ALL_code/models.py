"""

Also contains ALL, LabelEstimator, and GECriterion

All code takes in data as (n_features, n_examples), which is BAD and should
be changed, along with the weak signals.


To work on:
    Silent try/catches should be removed.
    Add logging to console.
    Switch data forms.
    Modify predict() and get_accuracy() as needed.
    Add more algos.
